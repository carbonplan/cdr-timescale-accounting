# Comparing CDR approaches

This repository contains code to support CarbonPlan's [explainer article](https://carbonplan.org/research/cdr-timescale-accounting) on comparing CDR approaches that remove atmospheric COâ‚‚ over different timescales. The explainer article uses direct air capture (DAC) and direct ocean removal (DOR) as examples to illustrate what needs to be taken into account when comparing carbon removal approaches that affect the atmosphere on different timescales. This involved running simulations in [Hector](https://github.com/JGCRI/hector), a simple climate model. We outline our methods in detail in `METHODS.md`. Please reach out to Claire Zarakas (czarakas@uw.edu) or CarbonPlan (hello@carbonplan.org) if you have any questions.
