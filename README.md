A CarbonPlan template for a developing a Python project

This CarbonPlan repository contains a template for developing a python project. To start, click on the green [Use this template](https://github.com/carbonplan/python-project-template/generate) button in the top right. This will allow you to create a new project using this base template.

This repository contains preliminary analysis for comparing and normalizing carbon removal across various CDR pathways, focusing on direct ocean removal to start. This involves running simulations in Hector, a simple climate model[https://github.com/JGCRI/hector]. The current workflow is to run Hector from the command line or using the R wrapper, and then to analyze results in Python. We're also making some simple modifications to the underlying Hector code, which is in C++.
